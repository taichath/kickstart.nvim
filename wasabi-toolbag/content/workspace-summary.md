# Workspace Summary

## Overview
This workspace contains a Neovim configuration based on the kickstart.nvim project, which serves as a starting point for customizing Neovim. The configuration is written primarily in Lua and focuses on setting up a modern development environment with various plugins for features like autocompletion, code navigation, and formatting.

```

## Languages and Tools
- **Primary Language**: Lua
- **Code Formatting**:
  - StyleLua for Lua files
  - Configuration in `.stylua.toml`:
    - Max line length: 160 characters
    - Indentation: 2 spaces
    - Quote style: Auto-prefer single quotes
    - Unix line endings

## Core Dependencies
The workspace uses `lazy.nvim` as its plugin manager and includes several key plugins:

### Editor Features
- **LSP Support**: nvim-lspconfig with Mason for LSP management
- **Completion**: blink.cmp with LuaSnip for snippets
- **Syntax**: nvim-treesitter for syntax highlighting and parsing
- **Formatting**: conform.nvim for code formatting
- **Git Integration**: gitsigns.nvim for git status indicators
- **File Navigation**: telescope.nvim for fuzzy finding
- **UI Enhancements**:
  - which-key.nvim for keybinding hints
  - mini.nvim for various UI improvements
  - tokyonight.nvim for colorscheme

### Development Tools
- Mason.nvim for managing LSP servers, DAP servers, linters, and formatters
- Built-in LSP configuration for Lua development
- Treesitter configuration for various languages including Bash, C, HTML, Lua, and Markdown

## Configuration Notes
- No specific logging framework is configured, but Neovim's built-in logging APIs are available
- No testing frameworks are present as this is a Neovim configuration
- The workspace uses standard Neovim plugin management practices and does not rely on Amazon-specific build tools or dependency systems

## Key Features
1. Integrated LSP support with automatic server installation
2. Fuzzy finding for files, symbols, and text
3. Git integration with inline indicators
4. Automatic code formatting on save (configurable)
5. Rich completion with snippet support
6. Modern UI with optional Nerd Font support

## Development Workflow
1. Plugin management through `lazy.nvim`
2. Code formatting handled by `stylua` via `conform.nvim`
3. LSP servers managed by Mason
4. File navigation and search powered by telescope.nvim

This workspace provides a solid foundation for Neovim-based development with modern features and extensibility.
